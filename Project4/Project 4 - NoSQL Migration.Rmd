## Introduction

Project 4 will focus on extracting data from a relational database and migrating the information to a NoSQL database.  This project will use Neo4j as the NoSQL database.  

Project requirements:

- For the relational database, options include using the flights database, the tb database, the "data skills" database created for DATA 607 Project 3, or another database of your own choosing or creation.

- For the NoSQL database, options include using MongoDB, Neo4j, or another NoSQL database of your choosing.

- The migration process needs to be reproducible.  R code is encouraged, but not required.  

- Briefly describe the advantages and disadvantages of storing the data in a relational database vs. a NoSQL database.


The code for this project requires the following R packages:

- RMySQL
- RNeo4j
- knitr

Additionally, to run this migration, the default Neo4j graphdb will need to be installed and running on your local machine.  


```{r env_setup, echo = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(RMySQL)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(RNeo4j)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(knitr)))


# MySQL DB info
proj_user <- "project3"
proj_pwd  <- "CUNYRBridge4"
proj_db   <- "skill"
proj_host <- "db4free.net"

```

## Source Data - MySQL Skill Database

The source of the relational data used in this NoSQL migration will be the skill database located on the cloud MySQL database (https://www.db4free.net/) created by the team for DATA 607 Project 3.

![skill ERD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfolsom98/DATA607/master/Project4/skill db schema.png)

Table and view data will be extracted from the cloud MySQL skill database using the function below:

```{r}

## ------------------------------------------
## Using RMYSQL
## ------------------------------------------

get_mySQL_data <- function(object_name) {
    
    # establish the connection to the skill DB on db4free.net
    skilldb = dbConnect(MySQL(), user=proj_user, password=proj_pwd, dbname=proj_db, host=proj_host)
    
    skilldb.data <- dbGetQuery(skilldb, paste0("select * from ", object_name))
    
    #close the connection
    dbDisconnect(skilldb)
    
    return (skilldb.data)
    
}


```

The table named `tbl_data` will be the source of the data being used in this project.  

```{r}

skill.data <- get_mySQL_data("tbl_data")

```

`source_id`  |  	Unique ID identifying a source (UK = skill_id and source_id)
skill_type_name   |  Highest level of classification of a skill.  1 of 5 values defined in the model -- business, communication, math, programming, visualization
skill_set_name   |  Mid-level classification of a skill.  1 of 32 values defined in the model.  Examples: General Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Relational Databases, Creative Thinking
skill_name   |  Skill name - the lowest level of skill classification.  1 of 122 skills defined in the skill db model.
source_name   |  Source name - Kaggle, Google, RJMetrics, Indeed

```{r, echo = FALSE}

str(skill.data)

kable(head(skill.data, 15))

```

## Migration to Neo4j

The following section migrates the skill data found in the Project 3 MySQL database to Neo4j. The default Neo4j graphdb will need to be running locally.  Additionally, this code requires the RNeo4j package in R.

### MySQL-Neo4j Migration Code - 1

The code below creates the following nodes in Neo4j based on the skill data sourced from MySQL:
- Source
- Skill
- SkillSet
- SkillType

In the MySQL database, a hierarchy exists between a skill, skill set, and skill type:  

    skill -> skill set -> skill type

where skill type is the top level classification.

In the Neo4j graph database below, a relationship is created from skill --> skill set and skill --> skill type.  This has been done to capture the weighted rating values as a property of the relationship between the Skill and SkillSet nodes and the Skill and SKillType nodes.

```{r}

graph = startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data", username = "neo4j", password = "data607")

# This statement will delete all contents from the connnected Neo4j database
clear(graph, input = F)

# Add constraints

addConstraint(graph, "Source", "name")
addConstraint(graph, "SkillSet", "name")
addConstraint(graph, "SkillType", "name")


# Use CQL (Cypher Query Language) to create the following nodes: Source, Skill, Skillset, and Skilltype
# Store the scalar rating value as a Skill property
# 

# Relationships
# 1.) A Skill is extracted from a Source
# 2.) A skill is part of a Skillset
# 3.) A skill rolls up to a skilltype

query = "
        CREATE (skill:Skill {name: {SkillName} })
           SET skill.ScalarRating = TOINT({RatingScalar})
        
        MERGE (source:Source {name: {Source} })
        CREATE (skill)-[e:EXTRACTED_FROM]->(source)
        
        SET e.rating = TOFLOAT({Rating})
        
        MERGE (skillset:Skillset {name: {SkillsetName} })
        MERGE (skilltype:Skilltype {name: {SkilltypeName} })
        
        CREATE (skill)-[i:IS_PART_OF]->(skillset)
        
        SET i.rating = TOFLOAT({RatingWeightedBySkillset})
        
        CREATE (skill)-[r:ROLLS_UP_TO]->(skilltype)
        SET r.rating = TOFLOAT({RatingWeightedBySkilltype})

"

# Open a new transaction 
tx = newTransaction(graph)

# Pass the contents of the skill.data dataframe to query above using RNeo4j appendCypher
for(i in 1:nrow(skill.data)) {
    row = skill.data[i, ]
    
    appendCypher(tx, query,
                 SkillName=row$skill_name,
                 Rating=row$rating,
                 RatingScalar=row$rating_scalar,
                 RatingWeightedOverall=row$weighted_rating_overall,
                 Source=row$source_name,
                 SkillsetName=row$skill_set_name,
                 SkilltypeName=row$skill_type_name,
                 RatingWeightedBySkilltype=row$weighted_rating_by_skill_type,
                 RatingWeightedBySkillset=row$weighted_rating_by_skill_set)
}

# Commit
commit(tx)

summary(graph)

```

The resulting graph database looks like this (not all nodes are shown):

![Neo4j Graph DB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfolsom98/DATA607/master/Project4/Neo4j2.PNG)

Based on the skill ratings created in the MySQL skill database, we know that **machine learning** is rated the highest skill.

```{r}

top10.skills <- get_mySQL_data("vw_top10_skills_overall")

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(top10.skills)
```

In Neo4j, issue the following CQL statement to selecting the nodes and relationships associated with the machine learning Skill node: 


**MATCH (n:Skill {name:'machine learning'})-[r]->() RETURN r**

The graph looks like:

### MySQL-Neo4j Migration Code - 2

An initial attempt at the Neo4j migration is shown below using more of the RNeo4j package.  Although the code created the nodes and relationships, it proved to be significantly slower and less clear than the Cypher code above.  Migration code 1 was preferred over the approach below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# load the MySQL tables into separate dataframes for migrating into Neo4j

source         <- get_mySQL_data("tbl_source")
skillset.list  <- get_mySQL_data("tbl_skill_set")
skilltype.list <- get_mySQL_data("tbl_skill_type")
weighted_skills_by_source <- get_mySQL_data("tbl_data")

# source 
for (i in 1:nrow(source)) {
    
    createNode(graph, "Source",  name=source$source_name[i], id=source$source_id[i])
}


# skillset 
for (i in 1:nrow(skillset.list)) {
    
    createNode(graph, "SkillSet", name=skillset.list$skill_set_name[i], id=skillset.list$skill_set_id[i])
}

# skilltype
for (i in 1:nrow(skilltype.list)) {
    
    createNode(graph, "SkillType", name = skilltype.list$skill_type_name[i], id = skilltype.list$skill_type_id[i])
}

sourceNodeQuery <- "MATCH (src:Source {name:{name}}) RETURN src"

skillsetNodeQuery <- "MATCH (sk:SkillSet {name:{name}}) RETURN sk"

skilltypeNodeQuery <- "MATCH (st:SkillType {name:{name}}) RETURN st"

for (i in 1:nrow(weighted_skills_by_source)) {
    
    skillNode <- createNode(graph, "Skill", 
                    name= weighted_skills_by_source$skill_name[i], 
                    id= weighted_skills_by_source$unique_id[i],
                    sourceID = weighted_skills_by_source$source_id[i],
                    skillID = weighted_skills_by_source$skill_id[i],
                    skillSetID = weighted_skills_by_source$skill_set_id[i],
                    skillTypeID = weighted_skills_by_source$skill_set_id[i]
                    )
    
    # find the source Node Name to create a relationship to in the next step
    sourceNode <- getSingleNode(graph, sourceNodeQuery, name=weighted_skills_by_source$source_name[i])

    # create the relationship between the skill and the source
    createRel(skillNode, "EXTRACTED FROM", sourceNode, rating = weighted_skills_by_source$rating[i])
   
    
    # find the skillset Node Name to create a relationship to in the next step
    skillsetNode <- getSingleNode(graph, skillsetNodeQuery, name=weighted_skills_by_source$skill_set_name[i])           

    # create the relationship between the skill and the source
    createRel(skillNode, "IS PART OF", skillsetNode, skillset_rating = weighted_skills_by_source$weighted_rating_by_skill_set[i])
   
    # find the skillset Node Name to create a relationship to in the next step
    skilltypeNode <- getSingleNode(graph, skilltypeNodeQuery, name=weighted_skills_by_source$skill_type_name[i])           

    # create the relationship between the skill and the source
    createRel(skillNode, "ROLLS UP TO", skilltypeNode, skilltype_rating = weighted_skills_by_source$weighted_rating_by_skill_type[i])
   
    
}

```

## Comparison - Querying Neo4j vs. MySQL

Several Top N views were created in the MySQL skill database as part of Project 3.  Using these SQL-based Top N views, create comparable CQL queries against the Neo4j graph database.

**1. Top 10 Skills**

```{r}

# MySQL
get_mySQL_data("vw_top10_skills_overall")


# Neo4j
query = "MATCH (s:Skill) 
         RETURN s.name as skill_name, SUM(s.ScalarRating) AS rating ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 10  "

cypher(graph, query)

```

**2. Top 10 Skill Sets Overall**


```{r}

# MySQL
get_mySQL_data("vw_top10_skill_sets_overall")

# Neo4j
query = "MATCH (s:Skill)-[r:`IS_PART_OF`]->(ss:Skillset) 
         RETURN ss.name as skill_set_name, SUM(s.ScalarRating) AS rating ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 10"

cypher(graph, query)

```

**3. Top 5 Skill Sets by Skill Type**

```{r}

# MySQL
get_mySQL_data("vw_top5_skill_sets_by_skill_type")

# Neo4j
query = "MATCH (s:Skill)-[r:`IS_PART_OF`]->(ss:Skillset)
         OPTIONAL MATCH (s:Skill)-[r2:ROLLS_UP_TO]->(st:Skilltype)
         RETURN st.name as skill_type_name, ss.name as skill_set_name, SUM(s.ScalarRating) AS rating 
         ORDER BY st.name, rating desc"


cypher(graph, query)

```


**4. Top 10 Skills by Source**

```{r}

# MySQL
get_mySQL_data("vw_top10_skills_by_source")

# Neo4j
query = "MATCH (s:Skill)-[r:EXTRACTED_FROM]->(src:Source)
         RETURN src.name as source_name, s.name as skill_name, SUM(s.ScalarRating) AS rating 
         ORDER BY src.name, rating desc"


cypher(graph, query)

```

**Note** - Aggregation seems relatively straight-forward using CQL and Neo4j.  However, I did encounter some challenges recreating SQL ranking functions such as a rank number within a group.  For examples #3 and #4 above, I could not find a way to rank using CQL, very possibly due to limited experience with CQL as a query language.


## Conclusion - Neo4j vs. MySQL

Having been new to Neo4j at the beginning of this project, one immediate disadvantage appeared to be the learning curve associated with simply using a NoSQL database. Relational databases and SQL are much more familiar in terms of usage and language features and constructs.  However, NoSQL databases seem to be much better at describing, using, and leveraging relationships between entities (nodes) for analysis. Visualizing data as a graph with NoSQL is a standard feature, unlike relational, databases which is valuable.
