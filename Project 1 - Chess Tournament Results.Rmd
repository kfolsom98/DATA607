## Project Overview 

This project will process a text file of chess tournament results stored in a cross table format as shown below.  The tournament results have some structure but will also require the use of regular expressions to extract key fields contained within.  

Below is an example of the chess tournament cross table structure.

The goal of this project is to generate a .CSV file (which could for example be imported into a SQL database)
with the following information for all of the players contained in the chess tournament cross table:

* __Player-Specific Output Fields__
    + Player's Name  
    + Player's State
    + Total Number of Points
    + Player's Pre-Rating
    + Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents

For the first player list aboved, Gary Hua, the information to be captured, calculated and ultimately exported will be:

Player's Name|Player's State|Total Number of Points|Player's Pre-Rating|Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents  
-------------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------- 
Gary Hua     | ON           | 6.0                  | 1794              | 1605   


Addtionally, the results of each player's seven matches will be converted from wide to long format.  This information will also be exported to a .CSV file, which could also be used as the basis for an import into a SQL database. 


* __Player's Seven Round Match Results Output Fields__
    + Player Number   
    + Round Number (1-7)
    + Outcome (**W**in, **L**oss, **D**raw)
    + Opponent's Player Number
    + Opponent's Pre Chess Rating


### Setup 

The R code for this project can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/kfolsom98/DATA607) under "Project 1 - Chess Tournament Results".  If executing the code, be sure to set your working directory to an appropriate directory in your environment.  Three files will be created in this directory: 1.) **tournamentinfo.txt** 2.) **Chess_Players.csv** and 3.) **Chess_Player_Matches.csv**.


The following R packages are required for this project: 

1. reshape2
2. dplyr
3. downloader
4. htmlTable
5. stringr

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(reshape2)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(dplyr)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(downloader)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(htmlTable)))
suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(stringr)))
```

##Data

###Loading and Understanding the File Format

The tournament results data used for the project can be found on GitHub below:

[Chess Tournament Results File](https://github.com/kfolsom98/DATA607/blob/master/tournamentinfo.txt)


Start by downloading the results file, called `tournamentinfo.txt', from the GitHub location.  This file will be downloaded to the current working directory.


```{r, eval = TRUE}

# location of the population CSV file on GitHub

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kfolsom98/DATA607/master/tournamentinfo.txt"

download_file <- "tournamentinfo.txt" # name of the file on the local machine after download

# the file will be downloaded to the working directory
downloader::download(url, download_file)

# read the file into a vector
conn <- file(download_file, open="r")
tournament.info.raw <- readLines(conn, warn = FALSE)

close(conn)

```

Let's look at the tournament info file which has been loaded into a character vector

```{r, echo=FALSE}

head(tournament.info.raw, 10)

```
Looking at the file's structure, we can see that the file has a header comprised of two rows:

![Header](C:\Users\keith\Documents\DataScience\CUNY\DATA607\Projects\Project1\ChessTournamentHeader.png)

The file also follows a fixed width structure but uses two different row formats to record information for a single chess player.  The formats are described below.

####Record Format 1

In the first record format shown below, the information for **Player Number, Player Name, Total Points, and the Round 1 - 7** results can be found.  The results for each round capture the outcome (Win, Loss, Draw) and the Opponent's Player Number.

![Record Format 1](C:\Users\keith\Documents\DataScience\CUNY\DATA607\Projects\Project1\RecordFormat1.png)

####Record Format 2

In the second record format below, the **Player's State, USCF ID, Pre-Rating and Post-Rating** values can be found.  The remaining fields are not considered in this project.

![Record Format 2](C:\Users\keith\Documents\DataScience\CUNY\DATA607\Projects\Project1\RecordFormat2.png)

Finally we see that file structure uses a hyphen character "-" as a formatting line between player entries.  Note that the combination of record format 1 and 2 form a complete record for each chess player.

###Processing the Data

To successfully process the tournament results file, several adjustments to the file contents will be made.  These adjustments will ultimately make processing the data into an R data frame easier.

1.  Convert the "->" used before the Post-Rating value to ">>"
2.  Remove all lines only containing hyphens.  This step will remove the formatting rows between player entries
3.  Remove the two rows comprising the header values
4.  Split entries into one of two vectors based on the record format. 

```{r, echo=FALSE} 

tournament.info <- str_replace_all(str_replace_all(tournament.info.raw, "->", ">>"), "-{3,}", "")

tournament.info <- tournament.info[tournament.info  != ""]

tournament.info <- tournament.info[-(1:2)]

# determine the format by looking at the contents of the first fiedl in the record

tournament.format1 <- tournament.info[str_detect(str_sub(tournament.info, 1, 6), "[0-9]")]

tournament.format2 <- tournament.info[str_detect(str_sub(tournament.info, 1, 6), "[A-Z]{2,2}")]

```


__Vector containg format 1 contents:__

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
head(tournament.format1, 5)
```

__Vector containg format 2 contents:__

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
head(tournament.format2, 5)

```

With the two record types split into vectors, we can now parse the records' fields while loading them into data frames.  Loading the data frames `format1_df` and `format2_df` from the vectors leverages the fixed-width nature of the chess results. Regular expressions will be used to extract the values for `uscf_id`, `pre_rating`, and `post_rating`.

**Step One** - parse the first record format for each player load into a data frame called `format1_df`.

```{r, echo=TRUE} 

format1_df <- data.frame(player_num   = as.numeric(substr(tournament.format1, 1,  6)),
                         player_name  = str_trim(substr(tournament.format1, 8,  40), side="both"),
                         total_pts    = as.numeric(substr(tournament.format1, 42, 46)),
                         round1       = substr(tournament.format1, 48, 52),
                         round2       = substr(tournament.format1, 54, 58),
                         round3       = substr(tournament.format1, 60, 64),
                         round4       = substr(tournament.format1, 66, 70),
                         round5       = substr(tournament.format1, 72, 76),
                         round6       = substr(tournament.format1, 78, 82),
                         round7       = substr(tournament.format1, 84, 88), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

```

**Step Two** - parse the second record format for each player into a data frame called `format2_df`.


```{r, echo=TRUE} 
format2_df <- data.frame(player_state  = str_trim(substr(tournament.format2, 1,  6), side="both"),
                         uscf_id       = str_extract(substr(tournament.format2, 8,  40), "\\d+"),
                         pre_rating    = as.numeric(str_extract(substr(tournament.format2, 8,  40), "(?<=R: ).\\d+(?=)")),
                         post_rating   = as.numeric(str_extract(substr(tournament.format2, 8,  40), "(?<=>>).\\d+(?=)")),
                         stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```


Combine the two data frames to create a single, consolidated record for each player.

```{r, echo=FALSE} 

results_df <- cbind(format1_df, format2_df)

header <- c("Player Num", "Player Name", "Total Points", 
            "Round 1",	"Round 2",	"Round 3", 
            "Round 4",	"Round 5",	"Round6 ",	
            "Round 7",	"Player State",	"USCF ID",	
            "Pre-Rating",	"Post-Rating")

htmlTable( head(results_df, 10), caption = 'Tournament Results -- Consolidated Record Layout', header = header)

```

###Processing the Final Output

Creating the final output will focus on calculating the value of each player's Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents played.  To do this, break the chess results data into a dataset only containing player information, excluding any information pertaining to matches played. Matches played in rounds 1 - 7 will be converted to a separate more normalized or tidy dataset.

**Chess Player Dataset**

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
player_df <- select(results_df, player_num:total_pts, player_state:post_rating)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE} 

header <- c("Player Num", "Player Name", "&nbsp;&nbsp;Total</br> Points&nbsp;&nbsp;",  
             "&nbsp;&nbsp;Player</br>State&nbsp;&nbsp;",	
             "USCF ID",	"&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Rating&nbsp;&nbsp;",
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Rating&nbsp;&nbsp;")

htmlTable(head(player_df, 10), caption ="Chess Player Information Dataset", header )

``` 

**Chess Player Matches Normalized Dataset**

The logic below creates a normalized dataset of the player's matches, where the match results are changed from wide to long format.  The data captured in the round 1 - 7 fields will be split to indicate the outcome of the round (Win, Loss, Draw, etc.) and the opponent's player number.

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
player_matches_df <-  
    results_df %>% select(player_num, round1:round7) %>%
    melt(id.var=c("player_num"), value.name="outcome_opp")  %>% 
    mutate( round        = as.numeric(str_replace(variable, "round", "")),
            outcome      = str_extract(outcome_opp, "^\\w+"),
            opponent_num = as.numeric(str_extract(outcome_opp, "\\d+$"))) %>%
    select(-c(variable, outcome_opp)) %>%
    inner_join(select(player_df, player_num, pre_rating), c("opponent_num" = "player_num")) %>%
    select(player_num, round, outcome, opponent_num, pre_rating) %>%
    arrange(player_num, round)
    
# rename pre_rating to opponent_pre_rating
names(player_matches_df)[names(player_matches_df) == "pre_rating"] <- "opponent_pre_rating"

```    

```{r, echo=FALSE} 

header <- c("Player</br>Num",   "&nbsp;&nbsp;Round&nbsp;&nbsp;", "&nbsp;&nbsp;Outcome&nbsp;&nbsp;",
            "Opponent's </br> Player Num",  
            "Opponent's </br> Pre Chess Rating")

htmlTable(head(player_matches_df, 10), caption="Example Chess Player Matches Normalized Dataset", header = header)

```

Aggregate the normalized match dataset to create the value for `opponents_avg_pre_rating`.  **Note.** In this calculation, only matches played with a Win, Loss, or Draw outcome are considered.

```{r, echo=TRUE} 
player_df <-  
    player_matches_df %>%
    group_by(player_num) %>% summarise(opponents_avg_pre_rating = round(mean(opponent_pre_rating))) %>%
    inner_join(player_df, by="player_num") %>%
    select(player_num, player_name, player_state, total_pts,  uscf_id, pre_rating, post_rating, opponents_avg_pre_rating)

```

```{r, echo=FALSE} 

header <- c("Player</br> Num",   "Player Name", "Player </br> State",
            "Total </br> Points",  "USCF </br> ID",	   "&nbsp;&nbsp;Pre-Rating&nbsp;&nbsp;",	
            "&nbsp;&nbsp;Post-Rating&nbsp;&nbsp;", "Opponents' Average </br> Pre Chess Rating")


htmlTable(head(player_df, 10), caption = "Example Final Player Result", header)

``` 

####As the final step, create the output .CSV files: Chess_Players.csv and Chess_Player_Matches.csv.

```{r, echo=TRUE} 

write.csv(player_df, "Chess_Players.csv", row.names=FALSE)
write.csv(player_matches_df, "Chess_Player_Matches.csv", row.names=FALSE)

```
